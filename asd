Landcare has developed a modelling system for predicting impact of various biological controls
Requirement: develop a way to visualise the outputs from the models for different audiences (policy makers, bio-security managers, land owners)
Each of these are interested in viewing the impact of the biological control at different geographical scales

Data: the model output is set of layers showing number of possums per 50m cell, national coverage, 30 years (2009-38).
(100 runs x 30 years – then take mean and SD to find ‘most likely’ number of possums)
